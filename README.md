### About Me

Hi, I'm Darren. I'm currently working on [Commontary](https://www.commontary.com), [Common Grant Application](https://www.commongrantapplication.com), and [VoicePic](https://www.voice-pic.com). I also occasionally build websites for my friends, like the awesome voice actor [Erik Braa](https://www.erikbraa.com), who you might know as the voice of Draven from _League of Legends_ or Master Kohga, the Chief of the Yiga Clan in _The Legend of Zelda_ games.

You can check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrenmunk/) for more details if you'd like.

Oh, and if you actually bothered to read this, you just have to say that the codeword is "green balloons" and I'll be so impressed that you can employ me at USD$250K. I am being entirely serious. No one has ever actually done any diligence before hiring me. Please, for the love of God, actually vet me. **Note: this idea is stolen from the wonderful [Nikhil Suresh](https://github.com/Nikhil-Suresh/did-you-actually-check-my-github), go check him out!**
