### About Me

Hi, I'm Darren. I'm currently working on [Commontary](https://www.commontary.com) and [Common Grant Application](https://www.commongrantapplication.com). I also occasionally build websites for my friends, like the awesome voice actor [Erik Braa](https://www.erikbraa.com), who you might know as the voice of Draven from _League of Legends_ or Master Kohga, the Chief of the Yiga Clan in _The Legend of Zelda_ games.

You can check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrenmunk/) for more details if you'd like.
